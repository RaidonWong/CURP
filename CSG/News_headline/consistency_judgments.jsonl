The mention of a march or protest, as in the headline, is a reasonable inference from the paragraph's description of a crowd being arrested and dispersed by police. The headline is thematically related to the content of the paragraph, as it discusses a protest or march that likely involved the events described in the paragraph. \n\nNote: The specific details of the headline (Alton Sterling) are not essential for this determination; the connection between the headline and the paragraph's content is based"}
